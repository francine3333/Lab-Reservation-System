# Lab-Reservation-System

Iâ€™m excited to share our latest project: the Lab Reservation System. This web application simplifies reserving computer lab slots. Users can view real-time seat availability across multiple labs and check both current and future slots. They can also see who has reserved a slot (if not anonymous) and access profiles via direct links.

To use the system, visitors must register with their email and password, creating accounts as either students or lab technicians. Students can reserve slots in 30-minute intervals, either anonymously or with their identity disclosed, while lab technicians can manage reservations for walk-in students and handle cases of no-shows.

The application also supports profile management, allowing users to edit their profiles, view public profiles of others, and manage their reservations. Students have the option to delete their accounts, which will also cancel any pending reservations.

We utilized Node.js and Express.js for backend development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and MongoDB for database management. Furthermore, GitHub was used for version control and collaboration.
